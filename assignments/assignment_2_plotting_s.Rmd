You will have to create 3 plots based on the datasets and instructions detailed below. You will find the plots themeselves in the `assignments/assignment_2_plots`. Your task is to write the code that will reproduce the plots as closely as possible.

# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), and working with factors (forcats)
-   Data visuzlization (ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(dplyr)   
library(tidyr)

```

## Task 1: Climbing expeditions

The 2020-09-22 TidyTueday datasets are about climbing expeditions. From the three datasets, use the "expeditions". Reproduce the plot below! Notice a few things:

-   Use `forcats::fct_lump()` to get the 15 most frequent peaks, and drop the "Other" category.
-   The bars are ordered by the sum of all expeditions (use `fct_reorder()`).
-   The bar colors use the viridis palette and light theme.

```{r}
tuesday_data <- tt_load("2020-09-22")
expeditions <- tuesday_data$expeditions

head(expeditions)

#  forcats::fct_lump() to get the 15 most frequent peaks, the rest - 'Other'
expeditions$peak_name <- forcats::fct_lump(expeditions$peak_name, n = 15)

# count of expeditions for each peak
expeditions <- expeditions %>% filter (peak_name != "Other")

sum(is.na(expeditions))

expeditions$peak_name <- forcats::fct_reorder(expeditions$peak_name, expeditions$year, sum)

# Create the plot 
library(viridis) 
ggplot(expeditions, aes(x = peak_name, fill = season)) + 
  geom_bar() +  
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +  
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 Most Frequent Peaks in Climbing Expeditions", 
    x = "Peak",
    y = "Number of Expeditions"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()  
theme_light ()
theme (legend.position = "bottom")

```

## Task 2: PhDs awarded

The 2019-02-19 TidyTueday dataset is about phd-s awarded by year and field. There is only one dataset, it is called `phd_by_field`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all phd-s by broad fields.
-   To make the x axis breaks pretty, use `scales::pretty_breaks()`, to make the y axis labels comma formatted, use `scales::comma_format()`.
-   The line size is 1.2, the colors are from the brewer "Dark2" palette. The theme is set to minimal.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries

library(scales)   
library(RColorBrewer) 

# Load the dataset
tuesday_data <- tt_load("2019-02-19")
phd_by_field <- tuesday_data$phd_by_field

# Check the structure of the data
head(phd_by_field)

# Aggregate the data by broad fields (sum PhDs awarded)
phd_aggregated <- phd_by_field %>%
  group_by(year, broad_field) %>%
  summarise(total_phds = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Create the plot using ggplot2
ggplot(phd_aggregated, aes(x = year, y = total_phds, color = broad_field, group = broad_field)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +  
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks()) +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format()) +  

  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + 
  labs(
    title = "PhDs Awarded by Broad Field Over Time", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Number of PhDs Awarded"
  )  

```

## Task 3: Commute in the US

The 2019-11-05 TidyTueday dataset is about commuting to work in each city in the US by bike or on foot. There is only one dataset, it is called `commute`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all commutes by state.
-   Both axis scales are log transformed and the labels comma formatted, using `scales::comma_format()`
-   The point size is 2, . The theme is set to light.
```{r}
# Load the dataset
tuesday_data <- tt_load("2019-11-05")
commute <- tuesday_data$commute

# Filter the data to include only Bike and Walk modes
commute_filtered <- commute %>%
  filter(mode %in% c("Bike", "Walk"))

# Reshape the data: Create separate columns for Bike and Walk commute counts
commute_reshaped <- commute_filtered %>%
  group_by(state, mode, state_abb,state_region) %>%
  summarise(total_commutes = sum(n, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = mode, values_from = total_commutes, values_fill = 0) 


# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(commute_reshaped, aes(x = Walk, y = Bike, color = state_region)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +             
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma_format()) +             
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format()) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = state_abb), size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE, color = "black") +
  theme_light() +                        
  labs(
    title = "Number of people walking vs. biking to work in each USA state",   
    x = "Number of ppl walking to work (log N)",             
    y = "Number of ppl biking to work (log N)",
    color = "State region"
  )
```
