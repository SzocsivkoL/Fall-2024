# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

dataset_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"

cocktail_dataset <- read.delim(dataset_url)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktailbar <- cocktail_dataset %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4/>") 

cocktailbar$ingredients <- gsub('[0-9.]|oz|%abv|abv|\\(|\\)|/|%|dash|dashes|drops|bsp', '', cocktailbar$ingredients)
cocktailbar$ingredients <- trimws(cocktailbar$ingredients)
```
## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cocktailbar <- cocktailbar %>% arrange(ingredients)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
unique_ingredients <- cocktailbar %>%
    count(ingredients, sort = TRUE)
print (unique_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10_ingredients <- mutate(unique_ingredients, rank = dense_rank(desc(n))) %>% filter(rank <= 10)                        
print(top10_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
ingredient_counts <- cocktailbar %>%
    group_by(name) %>%                 
    summarise(ingredient_count = n_distinct(ingredients))  

max_ingredients <- max(ingredient_counts$ingredient_count)

cocktails_with_max_ingredients <- cocktailbar %>%
    group_by(name) %>%
    summarise(ingredient_count = n_distinct(ingredients)) %>%
    filter(ingredient_count == max_ingredients)  

print(cocktails_with_max_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktailbar %>%
    group_by(ingredients) %>%                   
    summarise(cocktail_count = n_distinct((name))) %>%  
    filter(cocktail_count == 1) %>%              
 pull(ingredients)                                   

print(rare_ingredients)


```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cocktailbar %>%
    filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients) %>%  
    distinct(name) 
print(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cocktailbar %>%
    filter(!ingredients %in% rare_ingredients) %>%  
    distinct(name)  
print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients)
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cheat_sheet <- cocktailbar %>%
    mutate(value = "X") %>%  
    distinct(name, ingredients, value) %>%  
    pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = value, values_fill = list(value = "")) 
print(cheat_sheet)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
